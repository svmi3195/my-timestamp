Timestamp Microservice for <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice">this FCC exercise</a>
<br><br>
**User Story**: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
<br>
**User Story**: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
<br>
**User Story**: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
